My name is Esther Israel Okon. I'm 20 years old, born on 10th October,2002 and the fourth out of six children. I'm a 200 level agronomist student studying at Enugu state university of science and technology. I love computers in general and i think they're fascinating at least to me, so i took an interest in coding to dive deeper into understanding this interesting course.
